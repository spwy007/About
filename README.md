Here's some things that GitHub can do that I think are kinda cool

# GitHub pages (with Jekyll)
As it turns out, it's pretty easy to turn your `README.md` into its own stylish looking page. If you're not already, check out [this page](https://davidgilbertson.github.io/about-github) to see this readme wrapped in a Jekyll theme.

# Project board
Click [Projects](https://github.com/davidgilbertson/about-github/projects) up the top of this page to see the projects.

# Milestones
Here's an example [Go live](https://github.com/davidgilbertson/about-github/milestone/1) milestone with issues sorted into a particular order

# Wiki
You guesssed it, click [Wiki](https://github.com/davidgilbertson/about-github/wiki) up the top

# User Voice
You can track your feature requests, and allow users to vote, using GitHub issues. Describe the feature request, add an up and a down thumb. Then, with a link to your issues with the "Feature Request" label, you've got a feature voting system. Here's a short list of dummy [feature requests](https://github.com/davidgilbertson/about-github/labels/Feature%20Request).

I first saw this done by [Scrimba](https://github.com/scrimba/community/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)
